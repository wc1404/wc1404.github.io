			<li>Giant pandas (often referred to as simply pandas) are black and white bears. In the wild they are found in thick 		bamboo forests high up in the mountains of central China</li>

			<li>These magnificent mammals are omnivores. But whilst pandas will occasionally eat small animals and fish, bamboo counts 		for 99 percent of their diet.</li>

			<li>Pandas are BIG eaters – every day they fill their tummies for up to 12 hours, shifting up to 12 kilograms of bamboo!</li>

			<li>The giant panda’s scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca, which means “black and white cat-foot”.</li>

			<li>Giant pandas grow to between 1.2m and 1.5m, and weigh between 75kg and 135kg. Scientists aren’t sure how long pandas live in the wild, but in captivity they live to be around 30 years old.</li>

			<li>Baby pandas are born pink and measure about 15cm that is about the size of a pencil! They are also born blind and only open their eyes six to eight weeks after birth.</li>

			<li>It’s thought that these magnificent mammals are solitary animals, with males and females only coming together briefly to mate. Recent research, however, suggests that giant pandas occasionally meet outside of breeding season, and communicate with each other through scent marks and calls.</li>
